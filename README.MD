# Find PO numbers in a Document #

## Purpose of this code ##
In a standard environment where a customer wants to use the order matching functionality you can only capture one PO number from a document into the standard field *OURDOCNO*, without using the line recgonition functionality.

The *OURDOCNO* field is normally used to match the invoice against exisiting orders.
If you want to match an invoice against more PO's you could create a value in the *OURDOCNO* field that combines all needed PO numbers in one string concatenated by a "," Comma, e.g. *PO10000,PO20000,PO30000*

The idea of this customization is to find all PO numbers on a Document and concatenate them in the correct format.
This will enable the user to use the order matching based on amounts without the need of line recognition.
